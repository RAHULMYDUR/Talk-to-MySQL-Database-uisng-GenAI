### Talk-to-MySQL-Database-Using-GenAI

## Project Description

**Talk-to-MySQL-Database-Using-GenAI** is a Streamlit-based web application that enables users to interact with their MySQL databases using natural language queries. By leveraging a Generative AI model (Gemini API), this application translates natural language questions into SQL queries, executes these queries on the connected MySQL database, and presents the results in a user-friendly table format. This project aims to simplify database querying, making it accessible even to users who are not familiar with SQL.

## Features
- **Natural Language to SQL Conversion**: Use natural language to ask questions about your database tables, and the application will generate the corresponding SQL query.
- **MySQL Database Connectivity**: Securely connect to your MySQL database using your credentials.
- **Schema Display**: View the schema of the selected database, including the list of tables.
- **Query Execution**: Execute the generated SQL query and display the results in an easy-to-read table format with appropriate column names.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive and simple interface powered by Streamlit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- MySQL database
- Gemini API key for Generative AI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Talk-to-MySQL-Database-Using-GenAI.git
   cd Talk-to-MySQL-Database-Using-GenAI
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup your environment variables:**
   - Replace `API_KEY` in `query_execution.py` with your actual Gemini API key.

### Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. **Connect to your MySQL database:**
   - Provide your MySQL credentials (username, password, host, port) in the sidebar.
   - Click the "Connect" button.

3. **Select a database:**
   - Choose a database from the dropdown menu.
   - The schema of the selected database will be displayed.

4. **Ask a question:**
   - Type your question about the database tables in the provided text area.
   - Click "Generate SQL Query" to get the SQL query generated by the Gemini API.

5. **View results:**
   - The generated SQL query will be displayed.
   - The results of the SQL query execution will be shown in a table format.
